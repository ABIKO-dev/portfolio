# ABIKO-dev — Portfolio (Template)

This is a simple responsive portfolio template.

How to use
1. Replace placeholder text (name, bio, projects, email) in `index.html`.
2. Optional: change colors in `assets/css/styles.css` via the CSS variables in `:root`.
3. Add your resume and project images to `assets/images/` and update links.
4. For the contact form: replace `https://formspree.io/f/your-form-id` with your Formspree endpoint or use another form backend / Netlify forms / direct mailto.

Local development
- Open `index.html` in a browser.
- For a better dev server: `npx serve` or `npx http-server` in the project directory.

Deploy
- GitHub Pages: push to a repo and enable Pages (use `main` or `gh-pages` branch).
- Netlify / Vercel: connect the repo and deploy.
